# Analysis-OpenDS
To analyze and visualize all stuff after experimental studies.
<br>
## Motivation
Preprocessing, visualization and analysis is required for initial OpenDS data. Hereby, we gathered the analysis codes of OpenDS data for futher usages and replications. 
  
## Usage
python scripts/preprocessing.py carData_track1.txt

PS:If you want to add a new scene to analyze, than modify coordinates.txt
