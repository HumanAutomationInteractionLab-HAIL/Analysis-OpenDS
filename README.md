# Analysis-OpenDS
To analyze and visualize all stuff after experimental studies.
<br>
## Motivation
Preprocessing, visualization and analysis are required for initial OpenDS data. Hereby, we represent this analyze tool for OpenDS data.
  
## Usage
```python scripts/preprocessing.py ../examples/input/carData_track1.txt```

PS:If you want to add a new scene to analyze, than modify coordinates.txt

## File Illustrations:
Name | Type| Description
---|---|---
carData_track1.txt| Input | Vehicle data generated by OpenDS (eg. Speed (m/s))
section.txt | Output | Motion data split from carData_track1.txt by sections
position.txt | Output | Coordinate information split from carData_track1.txt by sections
planform.png | Output | OpenDS scene planform


## OpenDS Scene Planform Generation
An example of OpenDS Scene Planform by matplotlib.
